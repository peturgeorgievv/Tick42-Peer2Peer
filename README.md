# LENDit

LendIt is P2P lending platform that aims to connect people who need money with people willing to invest their money. The two sides can negotiate loan options such as period, interest rate and penalty rates. Upon reaching an agreement, the investor lends the specified amount to the borrower, who is obliged to pay his/her payments on time or will be charged with extra penalty fees.
